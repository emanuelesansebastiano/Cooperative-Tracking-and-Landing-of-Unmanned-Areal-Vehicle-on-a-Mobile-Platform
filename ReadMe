Steps to run 'move_coop_pkg' package
This package make a Parrot and a Turtlebot a really simple taking off and landing cooperative task.
Watch demo1.mp4 and demo2.mp4 to see the protocol.

To run the protocol:
.ROS indigo, or new versions, must be installed on all the computers
.Package 'turtlebot' installed using 'catkin_make' in the catkin workspace of Turtlebot's computer
.Package 'move_coop_pkg' installed using 'catkin_make' in the catkin workspace of your computer

Turn on devices:
.Turn on the Parrot;
.Turn on the Turtlebot and the computer related to it.

Link devices:
.link your computer to the Parrot's wifi;
.link Turtlebot's computer to the Parrot's wifi.

Change the .bashrc file of both computers,
add the following lines to establish who is the master:
[Using static IP is suggested to speed up the connection when you start]

"
# Network creation with your pc (<your IP>) and the other pc (<other IP>)
export ROS_IP= <your IP>
export ROS_HOSTNAME= <your IP>
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<other IP>:11311

echo *ROS_HOSTNAME: *$ROS_HOSTNAME
echo *ROS_IP: *$ROS_IP
echo *ROS_MASTER_URI *$ROS_MASTER_URI
"

For the computer you want to be the master of itself use the same IP in every place.

Right now everything is ready to start.

Run on Turtlebot's computer in two different terminals:
.roscore
.roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch

Run on your computer different terminals:
.roslaunch move_coop_pkg ardrone_hover_over_rondel.launch
.rosrun move_coop_pkg turtlebot_controller.py
.rosrun move_coop_pkg parrot_controller.py
.rosrun move_coop_pkg key_commander.py

.call the service 'Trim' to stabilize the Parrot

In the key_commander window there are all the instruction to start the protocol.

ENJOY!!!!!!
